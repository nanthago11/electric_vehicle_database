    <h1><b>Electric Vehicles</b></h1>
    <p style="font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:20px">An electric vehicle, also called an EV, uses one or more
        electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. An
        electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be
        self-contained with a battery, solar panels or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity. EVs
        include, but are not limited to, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and
        electric spacecraft.

        EVs first came into existence in the mid-19th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for
        motor vehicle propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the
        gasoline cars of the time. Modern internal combustion engines have been the dominant propulsion method for motor
        vehicles for almost 100 years, but electric power has remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as
        trains and smaller vehicles of all types.

        Commonly, the term EV is used to refer to an electric car. In the 21st century, EVs saw a resurgence due to
        technological developments, and an increased focus on renewable energy. A great deal of demand for electric
        vehicles developed and a small core of do-it-yourself (DIY) engineers began sharing technical details for doing
        electric vehicle conversions. Government incentives to increase adoptions were introduced, including in the
        United States and the European Union.</p>
